# Airline Data Analysis: SQL vs Pandas

## Overview

This project demonstrates advanced data analysis skills using both SQL and pandas on airline datasets. The analysis covers data exploration, aggregation, filtering, and visualization, showcasing the ability to translate business questions into actionable insights using multiple technologies.

---

## Objectives

- Demonstrate proficiency in SQL and pandas for data analysis.
- Translate business questions into clear analytical tasks.
- Validate results across different technologies for reliability.
- Communicate analytical processes and findings effectively.

---

## Datasets

- `airlines.csv`
- `airports.csv`
- `flights.csv`
- `planes.csv`
- `weather.csv`
---

## Analysis Tasks

Each task addresses a specific business question using both SQL and pandas. Example tasks include:

- Listing unique engine types and combinations.
- Aggregating and grouping planes by engine, type, and manufacturer.
- Filtering planes based on attributes like speed, seats, and year.
- Identifying top manufacturers and trends in fleet composition.
- Visualizing key findings.

---

## Example Business Questions

- What different engine types are represented in our aircraft fleet?
- Which manufacturers supply the most large-capacity planes?
- What is the age distribution of planes by manufacturer and engine type?
- Which recent planes are suitable for medium- to large-capacity routes?
